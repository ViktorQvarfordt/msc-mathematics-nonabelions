Summary: Statistical repulsiton $↦$ eigenvalues of $Uₚ$ $↦$ General characterization of $Uₚ$ in \cref{thm:general Up} $↦$ Explicit characterization of $Uₚ$ for Fibonacci anyons $↦$ consequences for statistical repulsion.

Important results: General characterization of $Uₚ$ in \cref{thm:general Up} $↦$ Explicit characterization of $Uₚ$ for Fibonacci anyons in \cref{thm:fibonacci U_p} and consequences for statistical repulsion.

Possible continuations: Improving the machinery for non-abelian statistics.
